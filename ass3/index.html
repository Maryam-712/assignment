    <p >WellBeing International (WBI) believes that providing access to appropriate resources helps to inform people about the
        choices they can make that will have a positive impact on not just themselves and their families, but also for animals 
        and the environment. WBI’s Global Awareness strategy consists of three major components: the WellBeing International 
        Studies Repository, WBI’s Website and our Direct Outreach via our newsletters (WellBeing News and Tales of WellBeing) and our social media pages. The newsletters translate current scientific knowledge into crisp, clear and readable articles that cover a broad range of issues addressing the interactions among people, animals and the environment (the PAE triad).</p>

        <p>Public demand for information has grown <span>dramatically </span> in the past twenty years. This demand has been fueled by new technologies that enable individuals across the globe to access a huge amount of information very easily and quickly from their computers and smart phones. Literally, the globe’s databases are in the palm of one’s hand.</p>
